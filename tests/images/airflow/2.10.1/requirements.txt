# This requirements file is used when creating a virtual environment for
# building and developing the Airflow image. It is not to be confused with
# the requirements of Airflow within the image. Still, they are largely similar
# apart from some additional requirements for type checking, e.g. boto3-stubs
# or similar stuff for aiding build and development, e.g. pydocstyle.
