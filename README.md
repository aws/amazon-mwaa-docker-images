## aws-mwaa-docker-images

This repository contains the Docker Images that [Amazon MWAA](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/)
will use in future versions of Airflow. Eventually, we will deprecate [aws-mwaa-local-runner](https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner)
in favour of this package. However, at this point, this repository is still under development.
