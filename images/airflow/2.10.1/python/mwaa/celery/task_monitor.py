# This per tasks buffer size allows us to store data for each incoming SQS message like
# the airflow task command contained inside and the SQS message receipt handle. The
# airflow task command helps with correlating an SQS message with its corresponding

# the queue if needed.

# Furthermore, if celery fails to remove the message from the queue, the message data
# will still be present in the shared memory blocks defined below. This limit will
# provide the needed flexibility to go beyond what is actually needed for the happy case
