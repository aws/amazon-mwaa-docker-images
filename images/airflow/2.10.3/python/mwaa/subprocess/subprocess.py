"""
This module contains the Subprocess class which we use manage subprocesses.

The Subprocess class is used for running Airflow components, e.g. scheduler, installing
requirements, and potentially other use cases requiring a sub-process. This class
supports capturing output from the sub-process and sending them to a Python logger. It
helps support CloudWatch Logs integration.
