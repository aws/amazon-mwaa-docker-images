"""
This module contain multiple log handlers to support integration with CloudWatch Logs.

It contains the BaseLogHandler class, which has some common functionality needed by
all of the handlers. It also contains a couple other handlers for different log
categories, e.g. SubprocessLogHandler for handling scheduler/worker/etc logs, and so on.

For Airflow 3 we added CloudWatchRemoteTaskLogger for task logging only due to the switch to
Structlog. It still inherits BaseLogHandler for metrics reporting purposes but the core logic
are different. e.g. Emit and set_context are no-ops as they are not called anymore, and
the log publishing part is in the processor property.

    In such scenarios, we create a sub-process, capture its stdout and stderr, and push
    them to CloudWatch Logs. In contrast, for logs related to task execution or DAG
    processing, Airflow has a dedicated logger name that we can just define a logger
    for and we are all set.

    some Python loggers, then we shouldn't use this class, and instead out for one of
    the other classes in this module, or create a new one. If, however, we want to
    capture logs for a subprocess, e.g. scheduler, then we need to use this handler.
